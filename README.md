Project made within 2-3 months that started on March 2024, made by Lukas, Adam. H and Joshua.




This project allows you to play a question-answer-based game that works exactly like a quiz.
It can be played either SOLO or with MULTIPLE PLAYERS.
You can create a username in order for your score to be saved and to avoid getting the same questions from game to game.
Your username, questions and score will be saved so that you can challenge yourself over and over trying to achieve the highest score.
Those questions will be sorted by theme and difficulty, which can be chosen at the beginning of the game.
Please keep in mind that you won't be able to save your scores and usernames if you play with friends.





--------------   REQUIREMENTS   --------------

SOLO : None, you can play directly on your computer using the interface.

MULTIPLAYER : At least 2 Micro:bits Cards. You will need one card for each player. (Max : 10 players)
